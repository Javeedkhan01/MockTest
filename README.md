# MockTest
This code is a tkinter-based Python application for an online mock test. It allows users to select a topic (JEE, NEET, Civil Services), set the number of questions, and take a timed test. The test includes fetching and displaying questions from an API, tracking scores, and providing feedback on correct and selected answers.
